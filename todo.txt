Potential Improvements
- Test game with Multi-Force PvP games?
- Item-group hide from players
- Balancing: Crafting speed, power, pollution, recipe factor
- Balancing: Rarer as distance gets further? Multiple types of machines based on distance? Tech to enhance machines?
- helmod doesn't recognize productivity modules as valid for big iron recipe
- Algorithm improvement to distance check to improve performance
- Compatability with faster loaders
- Icons for item-group mod support
